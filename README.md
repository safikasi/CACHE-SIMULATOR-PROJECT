# Cache Simulator

This Cache Simulator project demonstrates how cache memory operates using different mapping techniques: 
Direct Mapping, Associative Memory, and N-Way Set Associative Memory.

It was developed as part of the Computer Architecture (5th Semester) course to help understand 
memory hierarchy and cache performance.

---

## Features

- Simulates Direct Mapping, Fully Associative, and N-Way Set Associative cache designs  
- Allows user-defined associativity level (n) at runtime  
- Supports data loading and search functionality to check for cache hits and misses  
- Helps visualize cache replacement and access patterns  
- Designed for easy understanding and experimentation  

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Cache-Simulator.git

2. Build and run the cache simulator program.

3. Follow on-screen instructions to:

4. Choose a cache mapping technique

5. Specify the associativity level (n)

6. Load data blocks into the cache.

7. Search for data to test cache hit or miss behavior.

## Configuration

The simulator supports multiple cache configurations that can be selected dynamically at runtime.
---
You can configure:

Cache mapping type (Direct, Associative, N-Way Set Associative)

Associativity level (n)
---
This flexibility allows detailed testing and analysis of cache behavior.

## Project Insight

Developed for the Computer Architecture (5th Semester) course, this project focuses on how CPUs
handle data using cache systems. It provides a clear, hands-on simulation of:

1. Cache mapping methods

2. Memory hierarchy concepts

3. Data retrieval performance in cache memory
